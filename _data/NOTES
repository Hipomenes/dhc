Data Files

This is a recent addition in Jekyll that allows you to use data noted down in YAML format inside the _data directory that is accessible to you anywhere using the site.data prefix. For instance, I recently shifted the SDSLabs Team Page from plain HTML to Jekyll, and I used a data file to define all the required elements that are shown for every user. The data file looks something like this (_data/members.yml):

- name: "Abhay Rana"
  pic: "abhay.jpg"
  links:
    Facebook: "https://facebook.com/capt.n3m0"
    Twitter: "https://twitter.com/capt_n3m0"
- name: "Team SDSLabs"
  pic: "sdslabs.jpg"
  links:
    Facebook: "https://facebook.com/SDSLabs"
    Twitter: "https://twitter.com/sdslabs"

Then, I iterate over this data using the following syntax:

{% for member in site.data.team %}
<img src="pics/{{member.pic}}" alt="{{member.name}}">
<div class="img-bar">
  <span class="img-title">{{member.name}}</span>
  <span class="img-icons">
    {% for link in member.links %}
    <!-- link[0] holds the hash key = facebook/twitter -->
    <a href="{{link[1]}}"><img src="assets/{{link[0]|downcase}}.png"></a>
    <!-- link[1] holds the hash value-->
    {% endfor %}
  </span>
</div>
{% endfor %}

Earlier, you could have achieved the same thing by adding this data to your _config.yml file, but the _data folder allows you to store data properly in various files, if needed.
