I'm **David Horacio Colmenares**, and I’m currently a Doctoral Candidate at the [Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures](http://laic.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. During 2015-2016, I was a  fellow at the [Connecting Art Histories in the Museum](http://www.khi.fi.it/CAHIM) program, based in Berlin and run by the [Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz - Max Planck Institute](http://www.khi.fi.it/) and the [Staatliche Museen zu Berlin](http://www.smb.museum/en/home.html). During that period, my research focused on the intersections of early modern antiquarianism and Mesoamerica, by studying the networks of humanists, antiquarians and indigeneous nobilities, in places such as Seville, Madrid, Venice, Padua, Mexico City and Santo Domingo, who jointly created a Mexican antiquity through exchanges of knowledge, exegetical practices and artifacts. My dissertation, “Antiquarian Gazes on the Mexican Past,” studies the construction of a Mexican religious antiquity through the transformation of Mesoamerican *teteuh* (‘deities’) into pagan gods.
