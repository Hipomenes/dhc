There was a time, long ago, when I worked in publishing, and back then I dabbled in [literary translation](http://www.acantilado.es/persona/david-horacio-colmenares/). Years later, I also had a short-lived —and [award-winning](http://www.revistapantalla.com/festival/ganadores/2012/comerciales.php)— stint in [script writing and advertisement](http://jakob.mx). And before the demise of silver halide film, I was an aspiring [photographer](https://davidcolmenares.carbonmade.com). More recently, I occasionally publish art criticism in [ArtNexus](http://www.artnexus.com).
