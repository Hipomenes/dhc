# Alacena de nimiedades 

This is a collection of notes, minutiae, quotes and lists that are "too trifle, humble and trivial" to be worthy of a formal piece, but are far too important for my affective landscape to be simply discarded.

To be sure, this *Alacena de nimiedades* is a spin-off of don Andr√©s Henestrosa's endlessly-entertaining *Alacena de minucias*, itself a tribute to [Lizardi's *Alacena de frioleras*](/assets/alacena.png), a column that ran weekly from June 1951 to Feb 1969 in Mexico's *El Nacional*.
