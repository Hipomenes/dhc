# Alacena de minucias

This is a collection of notes, minutiae, quotes and lists that are *too triffle, humble and simple* to be included in any history or academic piece, but far too important in configure a deeply personal inner landscape. 

And to be sure, this *Alacena* is an homage to don Andr√©s Henestrosa's [endlessly-delighting namesake column](/assets/alacena.png), that ran weekly from June 1951 to Feb 1969 in *El Nacional*.
