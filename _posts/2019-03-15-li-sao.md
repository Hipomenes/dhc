<h1 class="f2 dark-gray measure lh-title fw1"> I tended many acres of orchids and planted a hundred rods of melilotus   I had raised sweet lichens and the cart-halting flower   and asarums mingled with fragrant angelica   and hoped that when leaf and stem were in fullest bloom   when the time had come, I could reap a fine harvest   though famine might pinch me, it is a small matter:   but I grieve that all my blossoms should waste in rank weed. </h1>
