![From "Ten Styles of Waka Poetry"]({{"/assets/orchid.jpg" | absolute_url}})

<h2 class="f2 dark-gray measure lh-title fw3">I tended many acres of orchids and planted a hundred rods of melilotus <br> I had raised sweet lichens and the cart-halting flower <br> and asarums mingled with fragrant angelica <br> and hoped that when leaf and stem were in fullest bloom <br> when the time had come, I could reap a fine harvest <br> though famine might pinch me, it is a small matter: <br> but I grieve that all my blossoms should waste in rank weed.
