The Internet 2.0 is dead. It's time to reclaim what is left, and to strive, once again, to transform computers and the Internet into tools that expand human action rather than destroyed it. What follows is a lightly annotated and ongoing list of resources based on the idea of *convivial digital technologies.* According to the Austrian philosopher, historian and social critic Ivan Illich, "tools foster conviviality to the extent to which they can be easily used, by anybody, as often or as seldom as desired, for the accomplishment of a purpose chosen by the user." Such description starkly contrast with our smartphones, tablets and laptops, which are no longer tools but resources- and attention-extracting devices endowed with a life of their own. If you are like me, or if you look around, you might have noticed that  digital technologies no longer foster creativity nor expand human making, but rather destroy attention, poison social interactions. The smartphone and social media complex, in particular, has utterly destroyed peoples capacity to perform sustained cognitively demanding tasks, interact with others, or simply sustain the necessary silence needed for introspection. And if you have been following the news the past 3 years, the social media complex has utterly undermined civic societies, from Myanmar to Brazi, from Germany to the US.

This list does not strive to be exhaustive, nor too long. It focuses on simple, time-tested solutions, that will allow you to once again be in control of your tools, and abandon the toxic media and bloated unsustainalbe technologies through which our frontal lobes have been hijacked.
