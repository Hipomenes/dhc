In an upcoming post, I'll describe in detail and make a beta release of what I've called David's IRE.
Here are a few snapshots of my gorgeous VIM-based research, note-taking and academic writing environment.
Think of a Zettelkasten Ã  la Luhmann meets a Wiki meets Devonthink's fuzzy finding meets a Scrivener-like writing environment.
But 10 times better.
And all in free, sustainable plain text, granular version control, and running blazingly fast in a 2011 laptop.

# David's IRE Shocase 

Here's the start screen, with recent edited files and some Cow Says wisdom (via Vim-Startify):

![IRE's welcome screen.]({{"/assets/david-ire.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Here's how the environment actually looks like. Notice the gorgeous syntax highlighting, structure folding and, on the left, Vim's spell checker:

![The actual IRE.]({{"/assets/david-ire2.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Bibkey auto-completion from my Zotero bibliography via Vim-Pandoc:

![Autocompletion.]({{"/assets/david-ire5.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Finally, this is how a PDF looks like:

![PDF output.]({{"/assets/david-ire3.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Or, as a webpage using my note-taking color code:

![HTML output.]({{"/assets/david-ire4.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Or, for more portability, as an Epub file that I read in my Kindle:

![Epub output.]({{"/assets/david-ire6.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Beautiful LaTeX typography, automatic cross references and figure numeration, and dynamic bibliographies are all nice and incredibly convenient. 

But this is nothing compared to the IRE's wiki functionality, to be shown in a upcoming post.
