In an upcoming post, I'll describe in detail and make a beta release of what I've called David's IRE.
Here are a few snapshots of my gorgeous VIM-based research, note-taking and academic writing environment.

### Here's the start screen, with recent edited files and some Cow Says wisdom:

![IRE's welcome screen.]({{"/assets/david-ire.jpg" | absolute_url}})

### And here's how the environment actually looks::

![The actual IRE.]({{"/assets/david-ire2.jpg" | absolute_url}})

### Bibkey auto-completion from my Zotero bibliography via Vim-Pandoc:

![Autocompletion.]({{"/assets/david-ire5.jpg" | absolute_url}})

### Finally, this is how the final PDF looks like:

![PDF output.]({{"/assets/david-ire3.jpg" | absolute_url}})

### Or, as a webpage using my note-taking color code:

![HTML output.]({{"/assets/david-ire4.jpg" | absolute_url}})

### Or as a epub file that I read in my Kindle:

![Epub output.]({{"/assets/david-ire6.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Beautiful typography, automatic cross-references and figure numeration, and dynamic bibliographies are all nice and convenient. 

But this is nothing compared to the IRE's wiki functionality, to be shown in a upcoming post.
