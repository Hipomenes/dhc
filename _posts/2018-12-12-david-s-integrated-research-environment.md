In an upcoming post, I'll describe in detail what I've called David's IRE, also known as a Poor Man's Zettelkasten of the Future.
Here are a few snapshots of my gorgeous Vim-based research, note-taking and academic writing environment.
Think of a Zettelkasten Ã  la Luhmann meets a Wiki meets Devonthink's fuzzy finding meets a Scrivener-like writing environment.
But 10 times better.
And all in free, sustainable plain text, granular version control, and running blazing fast in a 2011 laptop.
And never mind bloated Emac's org-mode: all in (almost) plain-vanilla Vim.

## David's IRE - A Showcase 

Here's the start screen, with recent edited files and some Cow Says wisdom, via Vim-Startify:

Here's how the environment actually looks like. Notice the gorgeous syntax highlighting, structure folding and, on the left, Vim's spell checker:

Bibkey auto-completion from my Zotero bibliography via Vim-Pandoc:

Finally, this is how a PDF looks like:

Or, as a webpage using my note-taking color code:

![HTML output.]({{"/assets/david-ire4.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Or, for more portability, as an Epub file that I can read in my Kindle:

![Epub output.]({{"/assets/david-ire6.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Beautiful LaTeX typography, automatic cross references, TOCs, and figure numeration; and dynamic bibliographies and lists of figures, are all nice and incredibly convenient. 

But this is nothing compared to the IRE's wiki/Zettelkasten functionality, to be shown in a upcoming post. Forget about Evernote or Devonthink: this is like growing a second brain.
