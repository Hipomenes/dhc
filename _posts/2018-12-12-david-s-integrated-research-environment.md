In an upcoming post, I will describe in detail what I've called `David's IRE`, also known as the Poor Man's Wiki or the Luddite's Ultimate Techno-Zettelkasten. 
Here are a few snapshots of my VIM-based note-taking, research and academic writing environment.
Think of the `IRE` as a combination of a Zettelkasten Ã  la Luhmann, a Wiki knowledge base with Devonthink Think-like fuzzy finding, and a Scrivener-like writing environment. 
And all in free, sustainable plain text, granular version control through Github, and running blazinggly fast in the terminal of a 2011 MacBook Air.
And never mind bloated Emac's org-mode: almost all works in plain-vanilla VIM.

## David's IRE - A Showcase 

Here's the start screen, with recent edited files and some Cow Says wisdom, via Vim-Startify:

![IRE's welcome screen.]({{"/assets/david-ire.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Here's how the environment actually looks like. Notice the syntax highlighting, structure folding and, on the left, Vim's spell checker:

![The actual IRE.]({{"/assets/david-ire2.jpg" | absolute_url}})

For bibliographic references, the `IRE`has Bibkey auto-completion from my Zotero bibliography via Vim-Pandoc:

![Autocompletion.]({{"/assets/david-ire5.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Finally, this is how a PDF looks like:

![PDF output.]({{"/assets/david-ire3.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Or, as a webpage using my note-taking color scheme:

![HTML output.]({{"/assets/david-ire4.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Or, for more portability, as an Epub file that I can read in a Kindle:

![Epub output.]({{"/assets/david-ire6.jpg" | absolute_url}})

Beautiful LaTeX typography, automatic cross references, TOCs, and figure numeration; dynamic bibliographies, lists of figures... are all great and incredibly convenient. 
But this is nothing compared to the Zettelkasten functionality implemented through plain-vanilla VIM navigation, to be shown in a upcoming post. Forget about Evernote or Devonthink: this is more like growing a second brain.
