>What do we know… of the world and the universe about us? Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow. We see things only as we are constructed to see them and can gain no idea of their absolute nature. With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos. - H.P. Lovecraft, *From Beyond* (1920)

- ["Notes on the Fourth Dimension"](https://publicdomainreview.org/2015/10/28/notes-on-the-fourth-dimension/), *Public Domain Review*. ~ The best introduction is this wonderful article by Jon Crabb. 
- ["What is the fourth dimenion?"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/What_is_the_Fourth_Dimension%3F) (1884). ~ CH Hinton's seminal essay.   
- ["Speculations on the Fourth Dimension"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327643.Speculations_on_the_Fourth_Dimension) (Dover, 1980) a selection of C.H. Hinton's works.
- ["Before Einstein: The Fourth Dimension in Fin-de-Siècle Literature and Culture"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jktqh1?refreqid=excelsior%3Ac1c7127d136dbb17db9e0c9e1c662d7f), Elizabeth L. Throesch (Anthem Press, 2017). ~ An interesting study of the fourth dimension an its wider aesthetic implications.
- [The Annotated Flatland: A Romance of Many Directions](), Edwin A. Abbott (Basic Books, 2008). ~ A very readable of the popular geometric novel by Abbott. 
- [Genealogía](https://zonaeeducativa.wordpress.com/instrumento-didactico/matematica/genealogia-cuento-de-felisberto-hernandez/)(1929), Feliberto Hernández. ~ An unexpected addition to this reading list is a short story by the Uruguayan writer Felisberto Hernández. I read —and was flabbergasted— by this little geometrical fiction many years ago, and while its geometry is entirely Euclidean, I like to think that it is an echo of Hinton and Abbott.
