> "Let us behold the sacred flowery mountain. Let us marvel at the flowery plains. The precious crow flower (*cacaloxochitl*), the precious colored basket flowers (*tecomaxochitl*), the colored bone flowers (*omixochitl*), the colored popcorn flowers (*izquixochitl*), the precious heart flowers (*yolloxochitl*) spread about sparking and bursting preciously into bloom; the spread about blossoming, sparking, becoming preciously colored, becoming spattered in precious hues, becoming sprink√±ed with gold; they lie bunched togerher on the ground."


Probably composed by Faustino Chimalpopoca Galicia (1802?-1877).
