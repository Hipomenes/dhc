In late 2016, at last, I decided to look back to the fugure and try as much as possible to avoid Graphical User Interfaces, both the tacky Skeuomorphic ones and the equally tacky flat-design ones. Since then, I spent most of my productive computer time either in the command line or in VIM, where I've practically taken residence. I'm now convinced that anything beyong Ncurses interfaces is wasteful and distracting, and that clickable images are evil. Nothing captures best my user interface philosophy than this:
