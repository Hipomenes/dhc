I've come to the realization that the short fiction that I most like is the one written as a diversion from erudite work. Here's an annotated list of English, French, Italian and Spanish works, but referenced only to the edition I have at hand (e.g. I use Marcel Schwob's English translations, since those are the ones I have here with me.)^[Shocking as it is, there's still not a Bibliotheque de la Pleiade edition of the great symbolist writer nor, for that matter, any decent modern edition of his collected works.]

- Marcel Schwob, *The King in the Golden Mask* (*Le roi au masque d'or*, 1892) Trans. by Kit Schluter)
- Vernon Lee, *La voz maligna* (*The Wicked Voice*)
- Vernon Lee, *El pr√≠ncipe Alberico y la dama Serpiente*
