![From *Ghost Stories of an Antiquary*, by M. R. James](http://www.thin-ghost.org/archive/files/scrapbook02_13cd22d9cc.jpg)

Consider it a professional bias, but some of the short fiction that I love the most was written either written as a diversion from scholarship, or look at scholarship as a fruitful resource for the imagination. In some cases, the short stories and novelas expand on erudite minutiae; in others, the quiet of scholarly life is regarded as the perfect background for fantasy or the uncanny. Yet in others, labyrinthian worlds and patterns emerge as a diversion from erudition.
Here's a short annotated list of works, in several languages, that I've enjoyed. In my humble opinion, the great master of the genre was Marcel Schwob, of "Le livre de Monelle" fame.[^1]


- Marcel Schwob, *Le roi au masque d'or* (1892) 
- Vernon Lee, *The Wicked Voice*
- Vernon Lee, *El pr√≠ncipe Alberico y la dama Serpiente*
- M.R. James, *Ghost Stories of an Antiquary*
- H.P. Lovecraft, *The Case of Charles Dexter Ward*. Perhaps the most scholarly of HPL's weird fictions. 

[^1]: Shocking as it is, there's still not a Bibliotheque de la Pleiade edition of the great symbolist writer nor, for that matter, any decent modern edition of his collected works.
