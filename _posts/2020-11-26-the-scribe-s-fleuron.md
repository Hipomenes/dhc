![Chimalpopoca Galicia, ms.]({{"/assets/faustino-fleuron.png" | absolute_url}})

Last folio of Don Faustino Chimalpopoca Galicia’s transcription of the *Cantares mexicanos* (ms 1628-bis; detail). 
This calligraphic fleuron—or perhaps we could say *tlilxochitl* ('ink flower')—that quite literally stems from the 'Laus Deo' is not only don Faustinos only personal mark on the 80-folio manuscript, but perhaps also a visual commentary on his own reading of the Cantares’s *xochicuicatl* ('flowery song') as Nahua expressions of the Chrsistian divine.
