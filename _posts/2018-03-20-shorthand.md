title: Shorthand, he wrote 
---

In the December 1893 issue of *The Shorthand Review*, a diligent reader reported his discovery, while examining the historic monuments of Westminster Abbey, of a monument ereceted in the memory of a "competent stenographer." In the north clositer of the Abbey, the anonymous reader of the Review found a "quaint tablet", bearing a funerary inscription dedicated to William Laurence, who died in December 28, 1621, at age 29 â€”a tender age even for a stenographer:

> "With diligence and trvst most exemplary\
Did William Laurence serve as Prebendary

> |And for his paines now past before not lost
> |Gain'd this remembrance at his master's costs.

|   O read these lines again; you seldome find
|   A Servant faithfvl and a master kind.
