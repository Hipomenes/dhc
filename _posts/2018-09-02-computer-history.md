Either a new genre of historical writing is taken shape before our eyes, or it's been there for a while and we're just begining to discover it. In either case, it's recent (is up to future practitioners of this emerging field to trace it's roots), and it's clearly thriving. Let's call it for lack of a better term "Computer History". And while the moniker sounds trivial, one only needs to peruse one of its pieces to understand that something new is in the making. At its best, the genre is a combination of institutional ethnography, micro-history, oral history, and the history of technology. And in the hands of its most ambitious practitioners, the history of software is an ofshoot of the history of science and intellectual history. The two computer historians I've been reading recently, with a mix of awe an exitement, are Sinclair Target, whose articles are published in his blog [Two-Bit History](https://twobithistory.org) and the persons that to my untrained eye seems the doyen of this emerging field: Jimmy Maher. Since 2011, Maher has been publishing a seemingly endless streams of software history, particularly on video-games, in his blog [The Digital Antiquarian](https://www.filfre.net). The name couldn't be more apt, and it happens to mix to things my few readers (2) will know I love with passion: videogames and antiquarianism.

For a taste of this emerging scholarship, I recommend to start with Sinclair Target's ["Where Vim Came From"](https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html) or, if Vim (the greatest text-editing technology ever devised) does not ring a bell to my dear reader, perhaps his history of the web, ["The World Wide Web and Its Inventor"](https://twobithistory.org/2018/06/10/birth-of-the-web.html). As for Maher, I recommend to start with his history of hyper-text,["The Freedom to Associate"](https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/the-freedom-to-associate/). (For videogame lovers, [his history of *Another World*](https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/another-world/), my favorite game of all time, is also worth checking out.)
