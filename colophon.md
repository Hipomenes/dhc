This is a static site writen in plain text, renderd by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and hosted freely at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The design is a fork of Dennis Tenen's [site](http://denten.plaintext.in), which uses the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) CSS framework. In its desing, structure and general feel, this site is inspired by notions of [Minimal Computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) and, more generally, by the conviction that all graphic design beyond typography is tacky and moraly objectionable. Ultimately, this site is dedicated to [Cosma's Home Page](http://bactra.org), aptly described as the "worst home page ever." Cosma Rohilla Shalizi's Home Page is so bad that it doesn't even use a CSS file. It has no index and no other structure than that which emerges from the sum of its internal hyperlinks.[^1] And yet, it is a monument to the possibilities of human curiosity and the promise of hypertext.
