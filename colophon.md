This is a static site writen in plain text, renderd by ``Jekyll`` through the ``kramdown`` processor, and hosted freely in ``Github Pages``. The design is a fork of Dennis Tenen's [site](http://denten.plaintext.in), with minor modifications by yours truly. In its desing, structure and general feel, my site is inspired by ideas about [Minimal Computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/), [Just enough] design, and in general, by the conviction that all graphic design beyond typography is tacky and moraly objectionable.  Ultimately, this site is dedicated to [Cosma's Home Page](http://bactra.org), aptly described as the "worst home page ever." Cosma Rohilla Shalizi's Home Page is so bad that it doesn't even use a CSS file. It has no index and no other structure than that which emerges from the sum of its internal hyperlinks.^[Notice that I failed to follow suit and I have kept a header on my site.] And yet, it is a monument to the possibilities of human curiosity and the promise of hypertext.
