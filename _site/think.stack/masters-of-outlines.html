<article><p>There are outlines. There are simple bullet-point lists (technically,
one-level outlines). There are proper two-level outlines, the first to
distinguish logical relation between items, and perhaps the mostly widely
used. Count a man happy if he spent his days being able to distinguish
something from its parts. Edward Tufte, the world-renowned expert on data visualization and book design,
has repeatedly claimed that a two-level hierarchical structure should suffice to organized anything, and as an example
he mentions the 3-volume Feyman lectures, a grand sum of physics in 1800 pages. “Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, he wrote,
but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.”<sup id="fnref:tufte"><a href="#fn:tufte" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="http://resources.christian-steinert.de/site/Buddhism/Reference%20Material/Visual%20Outline%20of%20Tsongkhapa%27s%20commentary%20on%20the%20Madhyamakavatara/illumination-outline-1.png" alt="Tsong-Khapa" /></p>

<p>Despite Tufte’s advice, there are and have been three-level outlines. Almost
anything could be made to fit within such structure, the first to
acknowledges that parts, while integrating larger units, might also be
composed of parts. Picking some examples at random, a three-level
structure has been sufficient to hold the universal history of the Nahua
people of pre-Columbian Mexico, comprising their customs, religious
beliefs, political institutions and natural history;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> the entirety
of human knowledge in the form of the <em>Propædia</em>, the first volume of
the 15th Edition of the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Spinoza’s
<em>Ethics</em>, which sought to demonstrate through the geometrical method the
truth about God, nature, mankind and civic society.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the Holy Spirit was not particularly inclined to speak
by means of cumbersome paratexts or typographical aids: the Hebrew and the Babylonian Talmud were
organized in a one-level structure of sections. Editorial outlining seized the Scripture only at the time of
Eusebius of Caesarea. The famed
Biblical scholar divided the Gospels in thematic sections, but
the current chapter structure was created much later: in 13th-century Paris, by
Hugh of Saint-Cher. Compared to these age-old traditions, the numbering
of versicles is a recent fad—the mid-16th-century— and it’s hard to
known whether it will stick. At least two contemporary editions do
without them. The <em>Summa Theologica</em> shows that a four-level structure
can already contain the whole of Medieval Theology and Philosophy,
detailed objections to it, and even more detailed refutations of those
objections.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The four-level structure also survives in old-school,
lengthy doctoral dissertations —a sign of hubris or mere boredom. To
write a five-level outline you must be either obsessive compulsive, a
German theologian or the author of a poorly-edited science textbook. I
can’t recall ever encountering a six-level structure or outline. Playing
with the automated indented-list function in my word processor, the
deepest I was able to reach without breathing was a dizzying ninth
level. After the seventh level, the standard Harvard Outline notation
starts to repeat, as in the further reaches of Pi.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>These are all
outlines. Even absurdly cumbersome outlines. But there are outlines and
there are  Tibetan outlines, sa-bcad (ས་བཅད).</p>

<p>Consider, for instance
Tsong-Khapa’s <em>Illumination of the Thought</em>, his commentary on Chandrakirti’s <em>Madhyamakavatara</em>. The structure of this
commentary would drive Edward Tufte mad: it spans into a gloriously detailed 20-level outline. See Christian Steinert’s <a href="http://www.christian-steinert.de/home/buddhist-reference-material/visual-outline-of-tsongkhapas-commentary-on-the-madhyamakavatara">recent 
visualization</a> of this outline to get a sense of its maddening complexity.</p>

      <p>This claim, however, flies in the face of actual books written and typeset by Edward Tufte, which as a rule distinguish between Parts, Chapters, Sections, Subsections and Paragraphs: 5 levels! See for instance Edward R. Tufte. <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>. Graphics Press, Cheshire, Connecticut, 2001. <a href="#fnref:tufte" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The <em>Outline of Knowledge</em>, the core of the <em>Propædia</em> created by

      <p>As everyone knows, Spinoza follows Euclid’s <em>more geometrico</em>. It
could be argued, however, that Definitions, Axioms and Propositions
cannot belong to the same level, in so far as each one presupposes
and is founded on the previous one, and also that a Proof cannot
stand in the same structural level as that which it is a proof of
(<em>i.e.</em> a Proposition). Fortunately, however, modern editions of the
<em>Ethics</em> have stuck to a manageable three-level structure. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The <em>Summa</em> is divided in Parts, Questions, Articles, Objections
and Responses. While Objections and Responses tend to be placed on
the same level, it makes more sense that Thomas’s <em>Respondeo</em> be
organized one level deeper that the <em>adversus</em>. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>A malevolent reader of Borges would retort than in fact, the whole
of human knowledge, the universe, God and everything that can be
named could be organized in the simple one-level alphabetic list:
an infite dictionary. <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
