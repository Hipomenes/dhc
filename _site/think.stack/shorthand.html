<time class="code silver f5">20 Mar 2018</time>
<article><p>In the December 1893 issue of <em>The Shorthand Review</em>, a diligent reader reported his discovery, while examining the historic monuments of Westminster Abbey, of a monument ereceted in the memory of a “competent stenographer.” In the north cloister of the Abbey, the anonymous reader of the Review found a “quaint tablet”, bearing a funerary inscription dedicated to William Laurence, who died in December 28, 1621, at age 29 —a tender age even for a stenographer:</p>

<blockquote>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>With diligence and trvst most exemplary</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Did William Laurence serve as Prebendary</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>And for his paines now past before not lost</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gain’d this remembrance at his master’s costs.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>O read these lines again; you seldome find</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

<p>Let’s ignore, for a moment, that this is the oldest use of the word “shorthand” on record for a lost art that until then was known as tachygraphy, or the likelihood that the term arose out of the need to fit this somber joke in a verse at the expense of a young prebend beloved by his master. The image is striking, and I personally find it deeply saddening: Death as a dutiful secretary, abridging lifes so save paper.</p>
