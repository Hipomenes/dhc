        <p>I’m <em>David Horacio Colmenares González</em>, Assistant Professor of Spanish at the Department of Romance Studies in Boston University, and core faculty member of the Latin America Studies program and the new MFA in Translation.

I hold a PhD from the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures at Columbia University in the City of New York, and a MA in Philosophy from KU Leuven, Belgium. During 2015-2016, I was a fellow at the [Connecting Art Histories in the Museum](http://www.khi.fi.it/CAHIM) program, based in Berlin and run by the [Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz - Max Planck Institute](http://www.khi.fi.it/) and the [Staatliche Museen zu Berlin](http://www.smb.museum/en/home.html). My research has also been supported by the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, RI, and Dumbarton Oaks (Harvard) in Washington DC. 

During this period, my research focused on the intersections of early modern antiquarianism and Mesoamerica, by studying the networks of humanists, antiquarians and indigeneous nobilities, in places such as Seville, Madrid, Venice, Padua, Mexico City and Santo Domingo, who jointly created a Mexican antiquity through exchanges of knowledge, exegetical practices and artifacts.

My dissertation, entitled "Taming Teotl: The Making of an Aztec Pantheon in Colonial Mexico" (Columbia, 2019) and under the supervision of Dr. Alessandra Russo, investigates how Aztec religious antiquity was codified in colonial Mexico by focusing on the transformation of Aztec divine figures of power (Nahuatl: *teteoh*) into "pagan gods." Through a wide range of texts, images, pictorial manuscripts and artifacts produced in colonial Mexico as well as in Santo Domingo, Spain, Italy and the Low Countries, I argue that the dominant interpretation of the Aztec gods that arose in the sixteenth century was an instance of the "reception of reception": the result of the creative deployment, by central Mexican native elites, of the interpretative strategies of the conquerors. I eschew from traditional ethnohistorical approaches by arguing that the figures that came to be known as the Aztec gods were in fact sixteenth- and seventeenth-century constructions that emerged from the convergence of Castilian historical culture, early modern antiquarian and humanist practices, and native interpretations of Mesoamerican tradition.

I'm currently a member of two international research projects: "From the Earth to the Skies: Celestial Images as Technologies of Cultural Transfer across the Americas" (JCB/UNAM) and "Itineraries Around an Artifact: the Vatican Codex 3738 and the Intellectual Spheres of the Sixteenth Century" (UNAM/La Sapienza).
