bio:

- short: "My teaching and research happen at the intersection of people, texts,
  and technology."

  long: "I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of English and
Comparative Literature, Columbia University. A former software engineer at
Microsoft and currently faculty associate at Columbia's Data Science
Institute, my first monograph, *Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation* is
forthcoming from Stanford University Press in 2017. I am now writing a book
that explores the possibility and limits of automatically-generated,
algorithmic literary systems.
  
  
My work appears on the pages of *Computational Culture*, *boundary2*, and
*Modernism/modernity* on topics that range from book piracy, unintelligent
design, and aesthetics of data visualization. I am a co-founder of Columbia's
Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities, a research collective whose
work has received numerous awards, major grants, and recognition from the
press in *The New York Times*, *Fast Company*, *Der Spiegel*, and *Le Monde*."
