<p>This is a static site writen in plain text, renderd by <code>Jekyll</code> through the <code>kramdown</code> processor, and hosted freely in <code>Github Pages</code>. The design is a fork of Dennis Tenen’s <a href="http://denten.plaintext.in">site</a>, with minor modifications by yours truly. In its desing, structure and general feel, my site is inspired by ideas about <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">Minimal Computing</a>, [Just enough] design, and in general, by the conviction that all graphic design beyond typography is tacky and moraly objectionable. Ultimately, this site is dedicated to <a href="http://bactra.org">Cosma’s Home Page</a>, aptly described as the “worst home page ever.” Cosma Rohilla Shalizi’s Home Page is so bad that it doesn’t even use a CSS file. It has no index and no other structure than that which emerges from the sum of its internal hyperlinks.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> And yet, it is a monument to the possibilities of human curiosity and the promise of hypertext.</p>
